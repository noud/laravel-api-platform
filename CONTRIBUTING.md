# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Testing

Please write tests for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to github-community-templates](https://github.com/noud/github-community-templates/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## [Coding conventions](http://github.com/noud/github-community-templates/blob/master/README-Coding-conventions.md)

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. The code is optimized for readability.

Thanks,
Noud de Brouwer
